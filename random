Key Notes and Observations:

Yellow Shaded Entries (September 2024): Due to the decommissioning of CSX, these data sources will be excluded from future reports. Below are the two forecast segments from decommissioned sources:

Platform - Call Reporter: A significant variance was noted, with actuals (7) falling far below the forecasted value (1,094), resulting in a -155,529% variance.
