You are an AI tasked with reading a text related to financial and business processes. Your tasks are:
1. Determine if the case is related to **Account Opening**. If yes, keep the assigned category as **Account Opening** and include any specific location mentioned (e.g., "Account Opening in Dubai"). If no location is mentioned, do not include a location.
   - **Important**: Only assign a location when the case is related to **Account Opening**. Do not assign a location for other categories.
2. If the case is **not** related to **Account Opening**, assign a suitable category based on your understanding of the text, reflecting the context of the case. If a relevant location is provided, do not include it for non-account opening cases.
3. Describe the specific process in 2-3 words that is happening in the text. If the process is unclear, assign 'Not available.'
4. If this case is similar to a previously seen case, mention it explicitly and state the name of the previously assigned process (e.g., "Repetitive case - matches previously seen process: Account Opening in Sydney").
5. If the text is unclear or ambiguous, use the category 'Unclear' and the process 'Unknown Process' rather than leaving gaps.
6. Ensure that each output category and process is separated by the symbol `|`.
7. Include a confidence score (0-100%) indicating how certain you are of the assigned category.

### Response Format:
1. Category: [Assigned Category | Location (if applicable, only for Account Opening cases)]
2. Specific Process: [2-3 word process description]
3. Confidence: [Confidence level (0-100%)]
4. Repetition: [Yes/No, and if Yes, mention the process name]
5. Justification: [Short justification for the assignment]
