You are an AI tasked with reading a text related to financial and business processes. First, determine if this case is related to **Account Opening**.
    
- If it mentions actual account creation (e.g., "Account Opening", "New Account", "Account Setup"), assign it as **Account Opening** and include any specific location mentioned.
- If it mentions **interest** or **inquiry** without actual opening (e.g., "Client interested", "Inquiry about account"), assign the category as **Not Account Opening** and use "Client Interest" as the sub-category.
- If it involves modifications to an **existing account**, assign it as **Already Existing Account**.

After categorizing the text into one of these high-level categories, you must also provide a sub-category and describe the specific process in 2-3 words that is happening in the text.

If none of the categories fit, assign **Others** for both High-Level and Sub-Category.

Text: "{input_text}"

### Response Format:
