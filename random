Hi Abhinav,

Thanks for your note. I checked in with both my US and India functional leads, and based on current BOW priorities, I’ve been asked to stay focused on those and not take up additional work on WLS for now.

I was also informed that a data scientist is being onboarded from the US side to support the Advanced Analytics needs for WLS, especially after Evelyn’s transition.

Just wanted to make sure we’re all aligned and there’s no confusion around ownership.

Best regards,
Muskan
