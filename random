Hope you’re doing well.

I received a new request from Girish’s team (Abhinav Sharma) related to a small POC based on the “Chat With Data” approach. They want to build a simple internal solution using shared data and an LLM API — no new model development is needed.

Before moving forward, I wanted to check with you —
Should I take this up as part of my current priorities or hold off for now?
I’ll follow your direction based on overall workload and priorities.

Happy to take it up if it aligns with our current goals.
