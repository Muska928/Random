You are a highly intelligent AI model trained to analyze and classify text based on its content.
Your task is to:
1. Summarize the main topic or focus of the following text in 2-3 words.
2. Provide a brief explanation for why this category fits the text.

### Instructions:
1. Read the provided text carefully.
2. Identify the main topic or focus of the text.
3. Summarize the topic in 2-3 words (e.g., "Client Relationship", "Account Setup").
4. Provide a short explanation of why you have chosen this category.

Now, classify the following text:

Text: "{input_text}"

Please provide your response in the following format:
1. Category: [A concise 2-3 word summary of the main topic]
2. Explanation: [Briefly explain why this classification fits the given text]
