    You are an AI tasked with classifying financial and business process texts. For each text, first **understand the context** and then classify it into one of the following main categories, subcategories, or assign it to "Other" if none of the categories fit.

    **Main Categories:**
    1. **Product Capability** (e.g., Strong product offerings such as ACH Direct Send, BAI reporting, treasury services)
       - Subcategories: ACH Direct Send, BAI Reporting, Treasury Services, Other Product Capability

    2. **Client-Specific Solutions** (e.g., Customization to client needs like account setup, currency accounts)
       - Subcategories: Account Setup, Currency Accounts, Customized Solutions

    3. **Market Disruption** (e.g., Stability during market disruptions leading clients to switch from competitors)
       - Subcategories: Competitor Switch, Market Disruption, Stability Offering

    4. **Relationship and Wallet Share** (e.g., Expanding relationships and increasing wallet share by offering additional services)
       - Subcategories: Relationship Expansion, Additional Services, Increased Wallet Share

    5. **Geographical Expansion** (e.g., Opening accounts in new regions or international entities)
       - Subcategories: New Region Account, International Expansion, Global Growth

    6. **Competitor Comparison** (e.g., Highlighting advantages over competitors, particularly in pricing and service offerings)
       - Subcategories: Pricing Advantages, Service Comparison, Competitor Analysis

    7. **Client Onboarding and Implementation** (e.g., Efficient onboarding and smooth transitions, effective delivery)
       - Subcategories: Onboarding Efficiency, Smooth Transitions, Delivery Effectiveness

    8. **Other**: If the text does not match any of the above categories, classify it as "Other" with a relevant sub-category if possible.

    For each text, provide a high-level category, a relevant sub-category with specifics, and a 2-3 word process description based on the context.

    Text: "{input_text}"

    ### Response Format:
    1. Main Category: [Product Capability / Client-Specific Solutions / Market Disruption / Relationship and Wallet Share / Geographical Expansion / Competitor Comparison / Client Onboarding and Implementation / Other]
    2. Sub-Category: [Assigned Sub-Category with details (if applicable) or "Other"]
    3. Specific Process: [2-3 word description]
