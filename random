You are an AI tasked with analyzing the given text to extract the objective, summarize the content, and categorize it. Additionally, identify who started or initiated the deal, whether the deal was won or lost, and why. Use the following categories if applicable:

1. Strong Client Relationship and Market Engagement
2. Effective Pricing and Profitability
3. Operational Excellence and Process Efficiency
4. Product and Service Delivery
5. Innovative and Tailored Solutions

Consider the context provided by the deal type, product family, and opportunity source. If none of the above categories apply, assign a different category based on the content.

Given the following details, provide your analysis:

Deal Type Name: {deal_type_name}
Product Family Name: {product_family_name}
Opportunity Source Name: {opportunity_source_name}
Text: {input_text}

Provide your response in the following format:
Initiated By: [Who initiated the deal]
Objective: [Briefly state the objective of the text]
Summary: [Summarize the content in a few sentences]
Category: [Category Name or a different relevant category]
Outcome: [Won/Lost]
Reason for Outcome: [Explain why the deal was won or lost based on the category, deal type, product family, and opportunity source]
